This is my attempt at a 16 x 16 version of Conway's Game of Life - using Elixir and Scenic.

Whilst I am satisfied with the end result, I'm not proud that it took nearly 4000 lines and some pretty jammy stuff...

I think the best way to run this file is to follow the steps on how to set up scenic as per this article,
https://blog.usejournal.com/elixir-scenic-snake-game-b8616b1d7ee0

then simply replace the two starter files with the two other files in this repository.
